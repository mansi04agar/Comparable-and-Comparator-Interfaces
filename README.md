# Comparable-and-Comparator-Interfaces in JAVA
The two java programs in this repository tells about how we can use comparable and comparator interfaces to sort objects.
I have also made use of LAMBDA expressions for sorting the objects using comparator.
Comments have been added at appropriate places for better understanding of the code.
